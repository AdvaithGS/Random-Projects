So the justification for this mess is that basically I make stuff whenever I want to, and you can't stop me.

Only mentioning the important ones becuase the AAAAAH im too lazy to talk about a file that contains descriptions of the JWST's progress in its early days.     

1. Assets: 
    
    a. `jameswebb.py` and `jameswebbnew.py`

        A set of tools to query James Webb data.


2. Automation:

    a. `whatsapp.py`

        A pretty nifty way to send whatsapp messages using python ;)


3. Passwords:

    a. `password.py`    

        Generate a password of input length and copy to clipboard

    b. `pwnedpass.py`

        Check if your password is pwned using the haveibeenpwned.com database 

4. Quizzes and Games:
    
    a. `Datatypesquiz.py`

        (TOTALLY NOT MISNAMED) This is a quiz challenges your ability to convert numbers in one base to another. Dont ask why this is an important skill.

    b. `maths.py`

        A quiz thingy that'll tingle your calculative bones and provide you the requisite daily dose of imposter syndrome. Good Luck!

    c. `tictactoe.py`

        Thankfully well named.

5. Tools:

    a. `calculator.py`

        Surprisingly, a calculator built in python - that is somehow incredibly inconventient and at the same time manages to polarize the radian and degree fandoms.

    b. `progress_bar.py`

        Can do exactly what you think it does, bells and whistles included.

    c. `randomword.py`

        Obtains an example of the provided part of speech, using an impressively inefficient method to do so. My only retort is that it was 2020, and I was half-awake.
